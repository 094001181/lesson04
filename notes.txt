Install npm i -g express-generator (installs globally)
Run express --view=hbs (to setup routes) - this automatically creates routes and views
hbs is similiar to angular and handlebars

npm - i restores all the modules that the application needs to work

4 commands in order
i -g express-generator (creates a basic project template)
express --view=hbs (setup routes and views)
npm -i (restore all the pkg modules (creates node_modules folder))
nodemon (starts)

test by going to http://localhost:3000 - you will see welcome to express


layout.hbs is the master template of the page {{{body}}} is where the content of the other pages will going


to add more pages - you need to add a view and a route

in app.js you will find the code that configures your application
import the route files that you create and you configure the routing
you configure middleware functions  - from top to bottom
error handling logic

//add a new route
res.render is taking the view from 'index' file and rendering the title: Express to the index view

Add About1
1. go to views folder and create about.hbs - add content to the file
2. Register route with application so it can be found when you go to /about
Option 1 - use existing router - modify index.js to add about
    In index - create a new res.render object to specify what to do with /about
Option 2 - about2
Create an about2.js in routes
In app.js - you need to do 2 things
1. create another object - var about2Router = require ('./routes/about2');
2. add app.use('/about2', about2Router);
